This implementation includes:

Apps Script (client-side):

A task pane with a login button
Backend function that sends the user's email and script ID to your AWS server
Token storage in the user's properties


Node.js (server-side):

MVC architecture (Models, Views, Controllers)
User authentication endpoint
JWT token generation
User creation if not found



To implement this:

Create a new Apps Script project and paste the Apps Script code
Set up your Node.js project with the provided backend code
Deploy your Node.js app to your AWS server
Update the URL in the Apps Script processLogin() function to point to your server

Would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or make any adjustments to the implementation?RetryCwhat are npm packages to installEditFor the Node.js backend code I provided, you'll need to install these npm packages:

express - Web framework for creating the API
mongoose - MongoDB object modeling tool
jsonwebtoken - For creating and verifying JWTs
cors - Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

You can install all of them with this single command:
bashCopynpm install express mongoose jsonwebtoken cors
You might also want to add these development packages:
bashCopynpm install nodemon dotenv --save-dev

nodemon - Automatically restarts the server when you make changes
dotenv - Loads environment variables from a .env file

After installing these packages, you'll be all set to run the Node.js backend I created for you!RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Cwhat will be the .env look likeEditYour .env file should include configuration variables for your application. Here's what it should look like:
Copy# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=mongodb://username:password@your-mongodb-host:port/appscript-users

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key_should_be_long_and_complex

# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# AWS Configuration (if needed)
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
Make sure to:

Replace the MongoDB connection string with your actual database credentials
Use a strong, unique JWT secret key
Change the port if needed (defaults to 3000)
Add AWS credentials if you're using AWS services directly from the Node.js app

Remember to add this .env file to your .gitignore to keep sensitive information out of your repository.RetryClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.Claude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
